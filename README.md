# odin-recipes
Hello to anyone reading this or just to my future-self! As you have already surely noticed, this project consists of creating a barebones webpage with links to a couple of recipes in it.
This project is meant to test my basic knowledge of HTML (such as working properly with text, adding images, links etc.), one that I've accumulated over the last couple of days thanks to The Odin Project.
This being my first ever project, I am quite looking forward to it, but I suppose you (or I) have already witnessed the result of it, as you are reading this. Well, here I go into creating this webpage and its future/present image!
